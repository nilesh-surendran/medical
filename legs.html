                <ul>
                    <li>Shin splints, more professionally known as medial tibial stress syndrome, is basically pain along the shin bone. It occurs because of overworked muscles, tendons and bone tissue.</li>
                    
                    <li>Symptoms - Some things to notice are tenderness, soreness, and/or pain. Maybe mild swelling may occur.</li>
                    
                    <li>Cures - The way to treat this is with rest, icing it, wearing proper footwear and to adjust your athletic routine. Over the counter medications might also work but consult a doctor before that.</li>                   
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>This is an inflammatory process that causes a blood clot to form. This blocks off one or more veins usually in the leg. Causes may include trauma, surgery or prolonged inactivity.</li>
                    
                    <li>Symptoms - Warmth, tenderness, pain, redness and swelling</li>
                    
                    <li>Cures - Apply heat to the painful area, elevate the affected leg, use an over the counter drug after consulting your doctor, and wearing compression stockings. The condition will usually improve on its own.</li>
